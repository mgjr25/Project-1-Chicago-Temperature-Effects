# Transportation-patterns

Description: Our team gathered a deeper understanding of the city we live, work and attend school in by evaluating how outside temperature affects Transportation as well as Public Safety in Chicago.

Data: Chicago Data Portal, Divvy Data, NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day Weather Data

Questions:

•	Temperature: Is there any relationship between outside temperature and daily taxi trips? If there is a correlation, will this also be the same for other forms of transportation? 

•	Divvy Bikes: What are the average temperatures citizens in Chicago start to ride more Divvy Bikes? How do freezing temperatures affect the Divvy ride volume? 

•	Crime: What are the average temperatures when crime occurs most frequently in Chicago? Are there any crime spikes during colder temperatures? If so, what temperature?
